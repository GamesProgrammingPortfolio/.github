# Games Programming Portfolio

## About
Here is the hub for all the small projects I develop as I learn how to make video games. 
I mainly work in C++ so the projects you find here will mainly be coded in that. 

Feel free to contact me about any of these projects. I'm still learning so I would appreciate any constructive feedback relevant to my skill level. 

## SFML Projects

## Develop at Ubisoft Project 
I'm happy to show people this project, however, due to signing an NDA I am not allowed to show the API that the code is attached to. That API is a custom API Owned by Ubisoft. 

## Sumo Digital 
(Please note, the Playbuffer Library that these works use belongs to Sumo Digital. I do not own the Playbuffer Library and have permission to share these projects using it).
Some projects are protected activities that Sumo Digital have requested I do not share on my portfolio, so some tasks from this internship are missing.
